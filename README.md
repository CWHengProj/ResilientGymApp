## Why was this app created?
- This app was created as a solution for myself to track my workout history, without having to keep an excel sheet and create a new row every time a new exercise is completed.
- I wanted an app that could provide me with the convenience of accessing my workouts on the go, without being tied down to a subscription service. Most exercise applications do not have an option for me to export my data, meaning a lot of the logs are lost if the user would like to try another application.

## Why **you** should use this application
- Clean and simple app makes it very user friendly even for beginners
- Take the stress off deciding what routine to use with prebuilt workouts
- Content creators / fitness influencers can create workouts to share with their subscribers, without worrying about equipment availiblity since users can configure the exercises used based on muscle group

## References, API
- This app uses the RESTful endpoints served here: https://github.com/wrkout/exercises.json
