# Resilient - the fitness app that gives your back your freedom

## App features
- Limitless customization - users get the flexibility to modify exercises based on the muscles worked. Other apps tend to lock the user to a certain exercise variation. This app allows users to adjust the exercises based on equipment availibility, or experience level.
- This app serves the current workout in the workout tab, where the weight automatically increases after the user performs more repetitions than their set target.
- Can share workouts seamlessly with other users
- Comes with prebuilt workouts for users to have a quick start
- Has an inbuilt timer 
- Export your workout history as a CSV
- Contact the developer to let them know any potential issues or areas of improvement for the application
- Can see workout descriptions by clicking the exercise name in the workouts page

## Why was this app created?
- This app was created as a solution for myself to track my workout history, without having to keep an excel sheet and create a new row every time a new exercise is completed.
- I wanted an app that could provide me with the convenience of accessing my workouts on the go, without being tied down to an online service. Most exercise applications do not have an option for me to export my data, meaning a lot of the logs are lost if the user would like to try another application.

## Why you should use this application
- Clean and simple app makes it very user friendly even for beginners
- Take the stress off deciding what routine to use with prebuilt workouts
- Content creators / fitness influencers can create workouts to share with their subscribers, without worrying about equipment availiblity since users can configure the exercises used based on muscle group
